# AngularTourOfHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.1.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to become better acquianted with the Angular framework and to learn Javascript with types (TypeScript).

Overall I feel the project was successful in teaching many of the capabilies that Angular has as a front end service and has directed me towards many more things I could learn to further improve.

Project is based off of the [Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
